## What It Does

For each city, LLaMA 3 generates a clothing suggestion based on the current weather.  
The first generation may take a few seconds, but the result is cached in Redis:

- If the same city is requested again, the suggestion is returned instantly.
- Each suggestion is stored for 1 hour, after which it will be regenerated upon the next request.
